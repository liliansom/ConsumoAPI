## Presentation
This is a project made for CSV Mentorship and consists of zip code API (Application Programming Interface) consuption. <br>
With this program you can search the address from the zip code of the client. Must be a brazilian zip code.

To build this program I used: <br>
Site Figma, Front-End https://www.figma.com/; <br>
VSCode, is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications, https://code.visualstudio.com/download; <br>
Python 3.10, https://www.python.org/downloads/;<br>
Requests Library; <br>
Via CEP, for the API, https://viacep.com.br/.<br>

This project was a great opportunity to learn how to consume API's and it's gonna be implemented at other projects. 

## Functionalities
You can search a brazilian address with the zip code of the client and fill in a formulary with this returned data.
Just open the ClassRequest.py and main.py at your prefered code editor and run main.py.
The program will ask you a zipcode number. After your input, it will return the name of the street, the neighborhood, the city and the state.
